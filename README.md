To run, clone the repo and open the solution in your IDE. Make sure the AccreditTechTest project is set as the start up project and run.

If you get an error like this when running the first time: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32780315/could-not-find-a-part-of-the-path-bin-roslyn-csc-exe
just clean and rebuild the solution.
